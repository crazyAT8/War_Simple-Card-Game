    - Making the simplest card game ever- WAR
        normal rules apply
        user vs the computer
            high card takes the cards
            tie or equal cards get kept by the players and go to the bottom of the deck
                object of the game is to get all the cards

    - Visually its really simple 
        26 cards ontop and on the bottom

    - Problem that we are trying to solve is how to set up all of our cards and what not...

    deck.js
        - function startGame
                * want to call the function right away
                * create a new deck
                * shuffle
                * split into two equal piles of cards
            deckMidpoint
                which divides the deck in two
            playerDeck & computerDeck
                global variables with empty values
                    in the startGame function give them values 
            console.log to test

        - cleanup function

        - determine the winner of a particular round
            isRoundWinner function determins the larger of the two cards
                but we need to assign values to face cards
        - CARD_VALUE_MAP
            solid hard coded variable that has all the values for the cards in the deck
                and the inRoundWinner function takes the first value and compares it to the second
        - Conditional if statement
            for what happens when the player wins
                it not only shows the words that you win 
                    but the card you gained goes to the bottom of your deck
                        push the player and computer cards to the bottom of the playerDeck
            else if for when the computer wins
                same thing just push the cards to the computerDeck
            else statement for a draw
                push the playerCard back to the playerDeck  
                    and push the computerCard back to the computerDeck
        - Need to check if one of the two players completely runs out of cards
            isGameOver function
                just checks if either of the two decks have zero cards in them
                    create this function and place it in another if statement in the flipCards function
        - Stop variable needs to be created
            set the stop to true in the conditional statement that was just created
                and set to false in the startGame function
                    and in the click EventListener add an if statement 
                    that if (stop) than call startGame function
        - else if statement to the flipCards function
            to check if the winner is the playerDeck
                show on the screen that you win and set stop to true
        - test this by giving the player or computer a deck of two cards 
            import {card} into script.js 
                export class Card from deck.js
